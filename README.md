# bot-wa

Simple and lightweight whatsapp bot starter using @mengkodingan/ckptw (based on whiskeysocket/baileys)
<br>
Using bun package manager and Nodejs as runtime (because bun is unsupported to run the bot)
<br>
To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.js
```
or
```bash
bun start
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.12. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
